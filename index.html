                    <p>I am currently in the process of creating a home lab to deepen my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in various aspects of IT. This self-managed environment allows me to explore and experiment with technologies such as virtualization, networking, and system administration in a controlled and secure setting.By setting up and maintaining a home lab, I aim to enhance my technical skills in areas like server deployment, network configuration, and cybersecurity.

                    <p>For a school project, we developed a Python Tic-Tac-Toe game with modes like player vs. player (PvP) and player vs. computer (PvE). The task involved collaborative work using agile principles, applying programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions, and managing our code on GitHub. It was a valuable experience to improve Python skills, understand game logic, and practice teamwork in coding while learning version control.</p>
